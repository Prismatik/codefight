POSIX Shell
===========
Just like the cool kids used to do it.

```sh
./server.sh [PORT]
```

It's a **single threaded**, yet **event driven** implementation with
unprecedented **intelligent prefetching** for **subzero response times**. Full
**security** against the latest _shellshock_ vulnerabilities built-in. It
is 100% compatible with newer kernels' **SYN-cookies** for **maximum
throughput** under heavy memory and resource limitations.
